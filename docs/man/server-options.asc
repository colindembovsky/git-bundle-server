*--port* _port_:::
  Configure the web server to run on the given port. By default, the port is
  8080.

*--cert* _path_:::
  Use the X.509 SSL certificate at the given path to configure the web
  server for HTTPS. Must be used with a corresponding private key file
  specified with *--key*.

*--key* _path_:::
  Use the contents of the specified file as the private key of the X.509 SSL
  certificate specified with *--cert*.

*--tls-version* _version_:::
  If the web server is configured for TLS (i.e., *--cert* and *--key* are
  specified), reject requests using a version of TLS less than the given
  version. The _version_ must be one of the following non-case sensitive values:

  - tlsv1.1
  - tlsv1.2
  - tlsv1.3

+
These strings match those used in the *http.sslVersion* Git config setting
(see man:git-config[1]). The default value is *tlsv1.2*. If the server is not
configured for TLS, this option is a no-op.

*--client-ca* _path_:::
  Require that requests to the bundle server include a client certificate that
  can be validated by the certificate authority file at the specified _path_.
  No-op if *--cert* and *--key* are not configured.

*--auth-config* _path_:::
  Use the JSON contents of the specified file to configure
  authentication/authorization for requests to the web server.
